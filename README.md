## Project plan
Project plan is available at [wiki](https://github.com/Achaad/data-mining-terrorism/wiki)

## Running the code
To run the preprocessing code, the following files must be executed in the given order:
1. dataset_preparing_1.ipynb (prepares the first half of the dataset)
2. dataset_preparing_2.ipynb (prepares the second half of the dataset)
3. dataset_preparing_3.ipynb (prepares the first half of the dataset)
4. merge_datasets.ipynb (merges the results from the previous three)

After running merge_datasets, you should have a final_data.csv file which can then be used in the files analysis_1.ipnyb and analysis_2.ipnyb to analyze the data.
